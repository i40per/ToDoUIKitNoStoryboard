# ToDoUIKitNoStoryboard

A minimalist **To-Do list app** built using UIKit **without Storyboards**.  
Designed for learning purposes and to demonstrate the MVP architecture pattern.

## 🧠 Features

- Fully programmatic user interface (UIKit + AutoLayout)
- Add tasks and delete individual tasks via swipe gesture
- "Trash" button in the navigation bar for deleting **all tasks at once**
- Clean implementation of the **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)** architecture
- Structured project folder organization

## 📸 Screenshots
